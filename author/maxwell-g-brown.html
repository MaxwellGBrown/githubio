</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>Re:Why The Fortune 500 is (Just) Finally Dumping Hadoop</h1>
<p>After ranting about "<a href="/everything-is-mapreduce.html">Everything being MapReduce</a>" I felt prompted to actually go learn more about MapReduce. Maybe my untrained eye is seeing apples everywhere there's oranges.</p>
<p>While perusing articles I came across an article suggesting that I'm probably wasting my time (and the title referenced in this rant's title): <strong><a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2021/02/17/why-the-fortune-500-is-finally-dumping-hadoop/">Why The Fortune 500 is (Just) Finally Dumping Hadoop</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Ignoring the strangely parenthesized "just" and the suggestion that <a href="https://github.com/MaxwellGBrown/mapreduce_docker_example">the hour or so I spent researching and running Hadoop in docker</a> was a waste of time, I actually saw some things that resonated with me.</p>
<h2>Maintaining Infrastructure is a PITA</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>...many of the world’s largest companies got that memo a few years back, that’s a lot of investment in hardware, tooling, time, and engineers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The central theme of this piece. With Hadoop you have to maintain (as I understand it) several different types of nodes of which more are added as the scale of the system gets larger.</p>
<p>When Hadoop was in it's hay-day, that was totally acceptable. Software teams were already constructed to work this way. DevOps wasn't even coined until 2009; you'd have your "infrastructure" team managing your servers (and likely on premisis too!) to work all of that for you.</p>
<p>The replacement of infrastructure with DevOps teams is a stark contrast of the times. Software teams no longer need infrastructure teams (they're probably employed by the Cloud Providers now!), and instead have a DevOps team/roles </p>
<h3>I'm not old</h3>
<p>...granted I wasn't <em>really</em> a developer at this point. This is my understanding of the software development world as I was learning as a student/junior and from secondhand experiences my seniors have shared with me.</p>
<h2>Cloud Services &gt; Cloud Infrastructure</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s the funny thing about Hadoop in 2021: While cost savings and analytics performance were the two most attractive benefits back in the roaring 2010s, the shine has worn off both features. It doesn’t help that cloud’s silver lining has beckoned to far more companies over that decades—all those big enterprises that were slow to take to AWS or Azure or competitors for security reasons. Now that they’ve made the leap, keeping that on-prem Hadoop gear on the floor and fed with specialized people and tooling looks even less attractive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Managing your own instances in the cloud might have been kosher in the 2010s, but with managed clouds and cloud services, offloading that responsibility saves software teams a LOT of responsibility and trouble.</p>
<p>Looking back, Docker and containerization wasn't prevalant then. I don't know this for a fact, but I'd be unsurprised if Hadoop didn't grow to fit into containerization well.</p>
<h2>On-Demand Compute &gt; Always On</h2>
<p>...which should seem like a no brainer to anybody working in the 2020s cloud environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...Mathur argues. “Having this always-on processing environment with Hadoop and paying for all that compute and storage is an ongoing cost. The amount of data nodes and infrastructure companies still need to pump into their data lakes what is often useless data is just not a scalable model.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this screams to me is scaling issues. My impression here is that, yes you can scale hadoop horizontally, but it <em>probably</em> (again, I'm no SME here) is harder than it should be. My (uneducated) guess is that since Hadoop requires dedicated nodes it actually depends on the CPUs &amp; memory of the server.</p>
<p>I can't see that fitting into the Cloud Service world really well.</p>
<h2>The rest of the article is about turning tankers</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If something works, even if it’s not the best or cheapest option, it’s not just about existing investment, it’s about the hassle and risk of change. For companies with tens of petabytes wrapped up in such a long-term investment, this is no joke. It’s a huge undertaking and if not managed properly it can create many days of downtime.</p>
<p>For the largest companies, it’s not practical to take the traditional consulting approach of going to individual business units to find out what data matters and to whom.</p>
<p>Although we like to think that the largest companies are the most innovative, for many in insurance, banking, healthcare, brick and mortar retail, and travel (to name a few) this is often not the case. Change comes slow because production IT environments are the engines of business. It takes those engines grinding to a halt or halting that production to spur new thinking—and this shift from Hadoop is only just now gathering steam among these giants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which I think is a point for smaller focused software teams embedded in their business units, which sounds super agile and fits more neatly into today's software environment. Infrastructure (cloud services?) can be maintained by a single DevOps seat, or maybe a team that loans out time to several smaller groups.</p>
<h2>Is Hadoop &amp; MapReduce Worth It?</h2>
<p>Okay, so maybe Hadoop isn't something worth dumping <em>all</em> of my time into learning (but learning a little more about it can't be harmful).</p>
<p>But this article leaves me stranded about MapReduce being <strong>a Good Thing</strong>. I get the feeling that many of the systems I find myself building are some form of MapReduce. Yet, Hadoop and MapReduce is on the way out.</p>
<p>So, maybe I'll leave my example as a "Hello World" while I continue to rebuild MapReduce over and over, until I find a better plug-and-play MapReduce alternative.</p>                </article>
