</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>Cinnamon Toast Software (aka "The Box Sells The Cereal")</h1>
<p>I've had the fortune of working at a "software" company for the last few years.</p>
<p>For some time I felt (maybe naively) that I was working for a <strong>software</strong> company. And I really enjoyed working for a <strong>software</strong> company! The job I held previously was as an internal swiss-army-knife for a <em>market research</em> company whom I made several small internal apps for, rarely with enough users to count on one hand.</p>
<p>I switched roles so that I could learn more about the world of <strong>software</strong> and to hone my craft from others who had maturing and developed skillsets.</p>
<p>For some time, that's exactly what happened too!</p>
<h2>The Facade</h2>
<p><img alt="The man behind the curtain" src="/images/man-behind-curtain.gif"></p>
<p>After settling into the role and company I began to see some patterns that I wasn't familiar with after my time working to solve problems internally at a <em>market research</em> company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deadlines being set often before the details of the project (or, even the product!) were defined</li>
<li>Functionality and feature sets defined and delivered to the development team with little-to-no input from a developer</li>
<li>Absolute stonewalling of any red flags and fire alarms raised by the development team</li>
</ul>
<p>The direct focus was to have "something" that we can have users on, as long as that "something" was exactly the full product, the "finished" design requested by those in charge.</p>
<h3>Iterative vs Incremental (vs Both?)</h3>
<p>Quick aside, this is a case study for the type of environment that breeds an "Itera-mental" (Iterative + Incremental) environment. That is to say, the negatives of developing both Incremental and Iterative while only gaining the positives of Incremental development.</p>
<p><img alt="Iterative vs Incremental vs On Time &amp; On Budget" src="/images/iterative-incremental.png"></p>
<p>The dynamic here being grossly misundderstanding both the software development cycle and the definition of an MVP.</p>
<p>Business people get so attached to the idea of a fully fleshed out product that they accept nothing less than that. They cannot grasp the concept that "quality" in the triple-constraint (or scope, if you're into the sex-tuple constraint thing) has a negative impact on "time", and that <a href="https://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/17069/what-does-it-mean-to-crash-a-project">crashing</a> a software project produces the <em>opposite</em> outcome (I could write a whole rant on this topic, but I feel like there's plenty of other people who have said it already).</p>
<p>Regardless of whether product functionality is delivered in an Iterative or Incremental fashion, <em>development is always incremental</em>. Even in developing a full "increment" a development team will work to the minimal functional implementation of a feature. </p>
<p>We can spend 4 months of our 8 month timeline (lol btw at expanding scope constraint with a locked time constraint) building the administration &amp; user management, but that leaves us half of our time to build the actual product for the users are going to pay for!</p>
<p>...I digress.</p>
<h2>Wasn't this about cereal or something?</h2>
<p><img alt="Cereal Meme part 1" src="/images/cereal-meme-1.jpg"></p>
<p>The Rock Family of Companies (collection of companies under Rock Holdings which includes Rocket Mortgage, previously known as Quicken Loans) has a set of <strong>ISMs</strong>-- <a href="https://www.quickenloans.com/blog/living-the-isms">a set of idioms that drive the company culture</a>.</p>
<p>The unveiling of the newest ISM (which is not a regular occurrance) while I worked in the family really clarified exactly the culture problem that I was experiencing. I'm pretty sure they're copyrighted or proprietary or something, so I'll paraphrase it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The box sells the cereal</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My initial reactions aside (sometimes they feel like horoscopes that you can uniformly apply to any walk of life), my realization is that this statement is validation for every MBA, big-wig, and marketer: "It doesn't matter what you make, it matters how you present it!"</p>
<p>Which entirely sums up my experience working at a "software" company. <em>Even if they thought they were</em>, at no point were the decision makers invested in actually creating quality software. I actually cannot stress that enough--I feel like I should write it a second time.</p>
<p><strong><em>Even if they thought they were</em>, at no point were the decision makers invested in actually creating quality software</strong>.</p>
<p>For them, it amounted to a marketing exercise: "With what vapid promises are we able to capture what segments of the market?" and connecting with other C-titles to make promises-of-promises. "What do you need from a software? Oh <em>we</em> can add that feature!" (to twenty different companies, while the product has not even been deployed to a production environment!)</p>
<h3>The cereal is a lie</h3>
<p>So, if the box sells the cereal, does it even matter what the cereal is?</p>
<p>Of course it does.</p>
<p>Remember "<a href="https://twitter.com/JensenKarp/status/1374051365417230336?s=20">Cinnamon Toast Shrimp</a>"?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ummmm <a href="https://twitter.com/CTCSquares?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CTCSquares</a> - why are there shrimp tails in my cereal?

<p>Let's not develop Cinnamon Toast Software.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer: Rock FoC &amp; ISMs</h3>
<p>At this point, I have only worked at a single of the (many) companies in the Rock Family fo Companies. I don't intend to for this to be a criticism or negative review of them (including the one I worked for), or the ISMs as a driver of corporate culture. In fact, I actually like them quite a bit (even if they're a bit Kool-Aid-y).</p>                </article>
