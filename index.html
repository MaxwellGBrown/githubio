</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>Faustian Tech Debt</h1>
<p>Many of the failed software projects I've worked on cemented it's downard trajectory with the same well-intentioned trade off: <em>"If we just stop doing <em>X</em> then we'll be able to get this through!"</em></p>
<p>Let me name a few from experience:
- Merge code without review
- Skip writing tests
- Disable checks in the CI so it'll pass
- Push right to develop
- ...I'm sure there are more</p>
<p>All of the above share the same intention: <em>temporarily</em> remove some of the overhead so that developers can deliver features in a more timely fashion.</p>
<p>The problem is not with intention (we all love Code Review &amp; Testing (right?!)). The problem is with reality. </p>
<p><strong>This is faustian tech debt.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Devil playing guitar" src="devil_0"></p>
<p>"Don't you think that's an exaggeration? We can always come back and re-address it!"</p>
<p>I meant what I said; the "debt" we now owe our soul to the devil. </p>
<p>In my experience there is no returning from this point. Once the proper practices have been eschewed to hit a deadline for a release, you have reached the point of no return.</p>
<p>I've even seen disciplined teams fail to recover from this: "If we write a ticket to address what we've just undone, then we can plan on readdressing it!"</p>
<p>No, in reality that ticket will be forever be deprioritized and you can stare at it loggingly after you scroll to the bottom of the backlog: "Oh man, I wish we had never sold our souls to the devil".</p>
<p><img alt="The Devil" src="devil_1"></p>
<h2>The Agile Manifesto Denounces the Devil!</h2>
<p>Nothing in the Agile Manifesto mentions timelines and project management, but it <em>does</em> advocate for continuous delivery. And not just in one of the principles, but in several!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and <strong>continuous delivery</strong> of valuable software.</p>
<p>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</p>
<p>Agile processes promote sustainable development.  The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</p>
<p>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll keep my point brief and simple: <em>if at any point you consider shortcutting your development process then you are <em>not</em> properly practicing agile development</em>.</p>
<h3>Short aside on project management fallacies</h3>
<p>I've worked on plenty of projects that completely eschew this though: "We want it on this date, we want exactly these features, and we won't touch resourcing."</p>
<p>To anybody with a working knowledge of project management, what they just heard was "I want it cheap, fast, and I want it all." which is a complete violation of the Triple Constraint philosophy.</p>
<p><img alt="Triple Constraint" src="triple_constraint"></p>
<p>Ineviably, what happens in the end is that something gives:
- The scope is less than promised (which leads to <em>another</em> cycle of "get these other features NOW!")
- The release date gets pushed back (and you already sold yourself short! Why'd we sacrifice our process again?)</p>
<p>and regardless of what gives, everybody walks away embarrassed.</p>
<p>I posit that nobody properly practicing agile would find thmselves in this scenario.</p>
<h2>In Conclusion...</h2>
<p>Don't destroy your process just to meet a deadline. Instad destroy the system which set a deadline that you cannot met without destroying your processes.</p>                </article>
